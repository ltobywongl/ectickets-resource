# Event Check-In Guide

On event day, ECTickets' web-based scanner makes check-in fast, secure, and contactless. No downloads or hardware required—just your laptop or tablet. The system validates QR codes with built-in integrity checks (hashed per-event secrets) to prevent fraud, and displays key ticket details for quick verification.

This guide covers accessing and using the scanner. Expect 1-2 minutes to set up per session.

## Accessing the Scanner

Each event session has a unique, auto-generated password for security. Generate and share it only with trusted check-in staff.

<Steps>
### Navigate to Attendance Management
- Log in to your [Event Management Dashboard](https://www.ectickets.com/dashboard).
- Select your event, then go to **Attendance Management** in the side menu (under "Sales Management").

### Copy Password

- Scroll to the **Session Password** section.
- For your session (e.g., "2025-11-04 20:00"), click **"Copy Password"**.
- **Copy** the password (clickable button) and share to the receptionist.

### Enter the Scanner Page

- Click the prominent **`https://www.ectickets.com/e-checkin`** link (or copy with the button).
- Paste your session password in the prompt and submit.
- You're in! The scanner camera activates (Please **grant permissions** if prompted).

</Steps>

## Scanning Process

The scanner uses your device's camera to read QR codes in real-time. Each scan validates instantly.

<Steps>
### Position & Scan
- Point camera at the attendee's QR code (on phone, printout, or wallet).
- Hold steady 6-12 inches away — pop-up dialog confirms capture.

### Review Ticket Details

- A pop-up dialog appears with:
  - **Validation Status** (In Progress/Valid/Used/Failed).
  - **Ticket Type** (e.g., Normal, VIP).
  - **Seat/Section**
  - **Discount Used** (e.g., "Students' Fare").
- Click **"Check In"** to mark as attended (updates dashboard live).

### Handle Edge Cases

- **Attendee List**: You can always get the details of attendees (Including name, email, seats for verification) in **Ticket Details Report**. Manual override is possible for extreme case.
- **Invalid QR**: Dialog shows error multiple times — issue manual override if needed.
- **Duplicate Scan**: Alerts and blocks re-entry.

</Steps>

## Best Practices

- **Browser Recommendation**: Use Chrome for optimal performance (camera stability, fast decoding).
- **Setup Tips**: Test lighting (avoid glare); use stands for hands-free.
- **Team Coordination**: Share passwords securely; monitor total check-ins via dashboard reports for real-time capacity.
- **Post-Event**: Scanner auto-locks after payout state.
