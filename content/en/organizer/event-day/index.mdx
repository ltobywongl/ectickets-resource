# Event Day Overview

Event Day is the culmination of your planning — where attendees arrive, excitement builds, and your event comes alive. ECTickets equips you with tools for seamless operations, from pre-event prep to real-time monitoring. Focus on the experience while our platform handles the logistics like check-ins, capacity tracking.

## High-Level Event Day Workflow

You can stay at the **公開發售 (Public Sale)** state to do live execution. Use the Event Management Dashboard for a real-time command center — track attendance and sales spikes.

<Steps>
### 1. Pre-Event Preparation (1-2 Hours Before)
- Review attendee list in **Ticket Details Report**: Print backups if needed.
- Generate session passwords for scanners (see [Check-In Guide](/docs/organizer/event-day/checkin)).
- Set up stations: Phones/tablets at gates, Wi-Fi hotspots, signage for check-in zones.

### 2. Check-In & Entry (Doors Open)

- Launch web scanners at `https://www.ectickets.com/e-checkin` with session passwords.
- Greet attendees: Scan QRs, verify details, issue wristbands for re-entry.
- Monitor flow: Dashboard shows live capacity.

### 3. On-Site Management (During Event)

- Track engagement: View engagement statistics in real-time analytics reports.
- Upsell opportunities: Promote merch/add-ons via on-site kiosks linked to your event page (WIP).

### 4. Event Wrap-Up (Post-Close)

- Advance to **出金 (Payout)** state for auto-reports.
- Debrief: Export data for insights (e.g., sales details).

</Steps>

## Best Practices for a Smooth Day

- **Tech Setup**: Chrome browser for scanners; backup power banks.
- **Team Briefing**: Share passwords securely; role-play common scenarios (e.g., duplicate QRs).
- **Safety First**: Comply with venue rules; have a lost-and-found process.
