# Dashboard Navigation Guide

Once your organizer account is set up, you'll land in the ECTickets Organizer Dashboard — a central hub for managing teams, events, and sales. The dashboard has two main layers: the **Team Management Dashboard** (for overall team oversight) and the **Event Management Dashboard** (for individual event handling). Navigation is intuitive, with a persistent side menu for quick access.

This guide covers how to get around, especially on mobile. Pro tip: Bookmark [ectickets.com/dashboard](https://www.ectickets.com/dashboard) for one-click access.

## Dashboard Layers Overview

- **Team Management Dashboard**: Your starting point after login. Here, you handle team settings, member invites, and creating new events. It's like your "control center" for the whole organization.
- **Event Management Dashboard**: Dive deeper into a specific event. Access it via links from the team dashboard. Each event has its own space for configs, sales tracking, and state progression.

## Navigation by Device

The side menu is your main navigation tool, but its visibility adapts to your screen size for optimal usability.

### Mobile View

- The side menu is **hidden by default** to save space — tap the **hamburger icon** (☰ three lines) in the top of any page to open it.
- Once open, click the close button or tap outside to close.
- Navigation works the same: Scroll through sections, tap links to load pages.
- Event switching: In the Events section, tap an event to enter its management view.

  Pin frequent pages (e.g., "Create Event") to your home screen for
  faster access. The menu auto-closes after taps for smooth flow.

2. **Returning Users**: Log in at the business login URL; it defaults to Team Home.
3. **Switch back from Event Management**: At the top of the side menu in any Event Dashboard, click the "Back to Team Management" link.
