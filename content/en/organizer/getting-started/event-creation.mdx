# Event Token Purchase & Creation

With your organizer account ready, the next step is securing an **Event Token** — your key to listing and launching events on ECTickets. Tokens ensure dedicated resources for each event while keeping things fair and scalable. Once obtained, you'll create the event draft in your Team Management Dashboard.

This page covers purchasing/requesting a token and filling out the creation form. Expect 5-10 minutes for the whole process.

> [!TIP]
>
> Tokens are tied to your team — purchase once per event. Subscriptions unlock unlimited grants; see [Pricing](/docs/organizer/pricing) for plans.

## Step 1: Purchase or Request an Event Token

Tokens cost HK$500 each (one-time, non-refundable) and grant access to full event features. Subscription users can request free allocations.
