# Organizer Account Setup

Setting up your organizer account is quick and secure — get started in minutes to unlock event creation tools. Whether you're starting fresh or joining an existing team, ECTickets makes onboarding seamless. If you already have a regular attendee account, you can upgrade it to organizer status without losing your data.

## Ways to Access the Organizer Sign-Up Page

You can begin the process through two convenient paths:

1. **From the ECTickets Footer**:
   - On any page of the ECTickets site, scroll to the bottom and look for the "Account" section.
   - Click **"Create Organizer Account"** link.
   - This takes you directly to the dedicated sign-up form.

2. **Via Team Invitation**:
   - If an administrator from an existing Organizer Team invites you, you'll receive an email with a unique invitation link.
   - Click the link to pre-fill the sign-up form (including the invitation code) and join their team automatically.
   - This is ideal for collaborators, staff, or co-organizers.

## Step-by-Step Sign-Up Process

Follow these steps to create or upgrade your account. The process ensures email ownership and team affiliation.

### 1. Fill Out the Sign-Up Form

- Navigate to the organizer sign-up page (via footer or invitation).
- Enter your **email address** and **create a strong password** (at least 8 characters).
- Toggle **"Create Organizer Account"** to **Yes** (pre-checked).
- If joining via invitation, the **invitation code** auto-fills — no manual entry needed.
- If you have an existing attendee account:
  - Use the same email to sign up.
  - Enter your original password to verify and link accounts.
- Click **"Sign Up"** to submit.

  and never stored in plain text.
</Callout>

### 2. Verify Your Email

- Immediately after submission, we'll send a **verification email** to the provided email address.
- Check your inbox (and spam folder) for the **"電子郵件驗證 - ECTickets"** email.
- Click the **立即驗證** inside the email to confirm ownership.
- If the email doesn't arrive within 30 minutes, return to the **sign-in** page and sign in with your credentials to resend the verification email.

### 3. Account Activation and Team Assignment

- Upon clicking the link, your account activates instantly.
- If via invitation: You're automatically added to the inviting team's dashboard with appropriate permissions (e.g., user or administrator).
- If no invitation: A new **Organizer Team** is created just for you, with full admin access.

## What Happens Next?

- **Dashboard Access**: Log in to [Dashboard](https://www.ectickets.com/dashboard) to buy an event token and start creating.
- **Team Roles**: Admins can manage invites and permissions post-setup.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - No email? Resend from the sign-in page by logging in again 30 minutes later or check spam.
  - Existing account issues? Use "Forgot Password" to reset.
  - Invitation expired? Ask the admin to resend.

<Callout type="info">
  If you have a non-organizer account, the upgrade preserves your
  attendee history (e.g., past tickets). Just enter your original
  password during setup — no new email needed.

Once set up, proceed to [Event Creation](/organizer/getting-started/event-creation) to launch your first event.
