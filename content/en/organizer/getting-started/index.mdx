# Getting Started for Organizers: Introduction

Welcome to organizing on ECTickets! Whether you're planning a concert, workshop, or corporate event, our platform streamlines the entire process from setup to payout. As an organizer, you'll have full control over your event details, sales, and analytics—all backed by secure, scalable tools.

This guide walks you through the high-level workflow. For step-by-step instructions, explore the [succeeding sections](/docs/organizer/getting-started/account-setup).

## High-Level Workflow: From Creation to Payout

ECTickets uses a state-based system to guide your event lifecycle. Once created, your event dashboard features an "Event Management" section with a progress tracker. Each state has a prominent button to advance to the next—ensuring nothing is missed. The core states are:

1. **活動創建 (Event Creation)**: Initial setup.
2. **活動設置 (Event Setup)**: Configuration and details.
3. **預售 (Presale)**: Internal testing and early sales.
4. **公開發售 (Public Sale)**: Go live for public purchases.
5. **出金 (Payout)**: Post-event settlement.

Here's the end-to-end workflow:

<Steps>
### Create Your Organizer Account

- Sign up at ECTickets with your email.
- Verify your details (business info).
- Access your dashboard immediately.

### Purchase or Request an Event Token

- Buy a one-time event token for HK\$500 (covers one event listing and setup).
- Or, if you're on a subscription plan, request a free token grant.
- Tokens are non-refundable but transferable to future events if needed.

### Create the Event

- In your dashboard, select "Create New Event" and use your token.
- Fill out the basic form: event name, date, venue, description, ticket types, etc.
- Submit to enter **Event Creation** state — your event is now drafted.

### Configure Event Details

- Proceed to **Event Setup** state.
- Add advanced settings: floorplans, pricing tiers, ticket designs, etc.
- Upload images, set capacity limits, and preview your public page.
- Most edits are locked after advancing—double - check here!

### Launch Presale

- Advance to **Presale** state once ready.
- Start internal ticketing: Send internal / VIP tickets to selected attendees.
- Monitor initial traction without public visibility.
- Distribute free or discounted tickets for promoters/influencers.

### Go Public with Sales

- When presale goals are met, advance to **Public Sales** state.
- Your event appears in ECTickets' public listings — attendees can discover, buy, and manage tickets.
- Track real-time sales, analytics, and attendee lists in the dashboard.

### Run the Event with Check-In

- On event day, use our web-based QR code scanner (no app needed) for seamless entry.
- Validate tickets, handle walk-ins, and log attendance.
- Generate live reports for capacity and no-shows.

### Finalize and Payout

- After the event ends, advance to **Payout** state.
- Review final reports (sales, fees, etc).
- We handle the payouts: Your net earnings (sales minus platform fees) deposited via bank transfer within 7-14 days.
