# Pricing for Organizers

Hosting events on ECTickets is cost-effective and scalable, with transparent fees that only apply to successful ticket sales. You set your own ticket prices, and we take a small platform fee to cover the infrastructure for secure ticketing, payments, and attendee management.

> [!TIP]
>
> Fees are deducted automatically from sales proceeds. Use your Organizer dashboard to track real-time revenue.

## Event Creation Fee

To get started, there's a simple upfront cost for creating your event:

- **One-Time Event Creation Fee**: HK\$500 per event. This covers initial setup, verification, and publishing your event page.
  - Paid immediately upon creating and going live.
  - Refundable only if the event is canceled before it becomes active (no sales initiated).

- **Subscription Plans**: For frequent organizers, we offer subscription plans that waive the one-time event creation fee and provide additional perks at HK\$800 per year.
  - No recurring charges — host as many events as you want during the subscription period.
  - Contact sales for more details, Click [here](https://www.ectickets.com/contact).

This fee ensures high-quality listings and dedicated support from day one.

## Platform Fees for Ticket Sales

Once your event is live, fees apply only to actual sales — no charges for unsold inventory.

Your net earnings = **Total Ticket Sales** - **Platform Fee** (per sold ticket).

- **Ticket Price**: You determine the full price (e.g., HK\$100 for normal seats, HK\$200 for premium). This is what attendees pay (plus their processing fee — see [Attendee Pricing](/docs/attendee/pricing)).
- **Platform Fee**: Charged only on paid tickets sold through ECTickets. It varies by ticket type:
  - **Normal Tickets**: 1% of ticket price (minimum HK\$1.00 per ticket).
  - **Internal Sales Tickets**: 1% of ticket price (minimum HK\$1.00 per ticket).
  - **VIP Tickets**: Flat HK\$1.00 per ticket.
  - All settlements in HKD (Hong Kong Dollars), paid out after event completion via bank transfer.
  - No fees for unsold tickets.

We handle attendee processing fees separately (they don't affect your earnings). The net earnings is visible in the Event Overview Report in your Organizer Dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Payout Schedule**: Earnings minus fees are settled within 7-14 days after the event.

### Quick Examples

Here's what you might net from common scenarios (in HKD; assumes all tickets sold):

| Scenario                 | Tickets Sold          | Gross Revenue | Platform Fees                                          | Net Earnings |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Small Event (Normal)** | 10 × HK\$100 (Normal) | HK\$1,000.00  | 10 × (1% of HK\$100 = HK\$1.00) = HK\$10.00            | HK\$990.00   |
| **VIP-Focused Event**    | 20 × HK\$100 (VIP)    | HK\$2,000.00  | 20 × HK\$1.00 = HK\$20.00                              | HK\$1,980.00 |
| **Low-Price Ticket**     | 10 × HK\$50 (Normal)  | HK\$500.00    | 10 × HK\$1.00 (min applied; 1% = HK\$0.50) = HK\$10.00 | HK\$490.00   |

## Transaction Tips

- **Refunds & Adjustments**: We cover refund processing; you retain fees on non-refunded sales.
