# Pricing for Attendees

Buying tickets on ECTickets is straightforward and transparent—no surprise charges! The price you see for an event is the base ticket cost set by the organizer. At checkout, we'll add a small processing fee based on your chosen payment method to cover secure handling. This fee helps keep the platform running smoothly.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Always review the full breakdown at checkout. Promo codes or group discounts can lower your total!

## How Pricing Works

Your total cost = **Base Ticket Price** + **Processing Fee** (per transaction, varies by payment method).

- **Ticket Price**: Determined by the event organizer (e.g., HK\$100 for normal seats, HK\$200 for premium seats). This includes any organizer-added taxes or service charges.
- **Processing Fee**: A one-time charge for secure payment processing. It depends on your selected method:
  - **Credit/Debit Card**: 3.9% of your order subtotal + HK\$2.35, (minimum of \$8.00 per ticket).
  - **AlipayHK**: 2.7% of your order subtotal + HK\$1.20, (minimum of \$5.00 per ticket).
  - Applies to the entire order (not per ticket).
  - No fees deducted from refunds on eligible tickets—full base price returned.
  - All payments are settled in HKD (Hong Kong Dollars).

> [!TIP]
>
> **Free Tickets**: There is no processing fee added if the ticket price is free.

We don't add extra platform fees on top—everything's included for a hassle-free buy. Exact fees are displayed at checkout based on real-time rates.
